# Project Brief: NoteSphere

## 1. Overview
NoteSphere is a modern, privacy-focused note-taking application designed for users who value a clean interface and powerful writing assistance. It integrates a sophisticated, locally-processed grammar and style checker, ensuring that user data remains secure and private.

## 2. Core Problem
In a world of cloud-based services, users are increasingly concerned about the privacy of their personal and professional notes. Existing solutions often require an internet connection and send data to third-party servers for processing, creating security risks. NoteSphere addresses this by providing a powerful, offline-first, and 100% private writing environment.

## 3. Target Audience
- **Primary**: Privacy-conscious professionals, writers, and students.
- **Secondary**: Anyone looking for a minimalist, high-performance note-taking app.

## 4. Key Goals & Objectives
- **Privacy First**: All user data, including notes and grammar analysis, must be processed locally.
- **High-Performance**: The application must be fast and responsive, even with large documents.
- **Advanced Writing Assistance**: Integrate a "better-than-Grammarly" grammar and style engine.
- **Seamless User Experience**: Provide a clean, intuitive, and distraction-free interface.

## 5. Scope
- **Core Features**:
    - Note creation, editing, and deletion.
    - Real-time, local grammar and style checking.
    - Theming and font customization.
