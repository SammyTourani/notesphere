# Active Context

## 1. Current Focus
The primary focus is on completing the "Ultimate Grammar System V2." This involves integrating multiple grammar and style-checking engines to provide a comprehensive, privacy-focused writing assistant.

## 2. Recent Changes
- Initialized the Memory Bank to establish a long-term context for the project.
- Created the core Memory Bank files: `projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, and `progress.md`.

## 3. Next Steps
- Populate the remaining Memory Bank files with relevant information.
- Begin implementing the "Mega Engine" as part of the Ultimate Grammar System V2.

## 4. Key Decisions & Patterns
- **Memory Bank**: A structured set of markdown files will be used to maintain long-term project context.
- **Modular Architecture**: The grammar system will be built with a modular design to allow for easy integration of new engines.

## 5. Learnings & Insights
- A well-defined Memory Bank is essential for maintaining context and ensuring consistent progress.
- The `ULTIMATE_GRAMMAR_V2_ROADMAP.md` provides a clear vision for the grammar system's development.
