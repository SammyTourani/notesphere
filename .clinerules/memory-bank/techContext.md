# Tech Context

## 1. Technologies Used

- **State Management**: React Context API
- **Grammar Engine**: Custom-built with WebAssembly (WASM)
- **Local Storage**: IndexedDB for caching and storing notes
- **Version Control**: Git and GitHub

## 2. Development Setup
- **Package Manager**: npm
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Linting**: ESLint
- **Code Formatting**: Prettier

## 3. Technical Constraints
- **Offline First**: The application must be fully functional without an internet connection.
- **Browser Compatibility**: Must support the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.
- **Performance**: The grammar engine must process text in real-time without noticeable lag.

## 4. Dependencies
- A detailed list of dependencies can be found in the `package.json` file.

## 5. Tool Usage Patterns
- **Component-Based Development**: The UI is built using a modular, component-based approach.
