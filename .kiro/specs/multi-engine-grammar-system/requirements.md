# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The NoteSphere MegaEngine Grammar Assistant aims to be a free, infinitely scalable, flagship-quality grammar assistant that combines multiple best-of-breed engines (nlprule WASM, Hunspell, style linters, optional ML) into a unified, high-performance pipeline. The system should outpace commercial tools like Grammarly while maintaining high accuracy, performance, and user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Multi-Engine Integration

**User Story:** As a NoteSphere user, I want a comprehensive grammar checking system that combines multiple specialized engines, so that I receive accurate and diverse feedback on my writing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the grammar assistant is initialized THEN the system SHALL load and configure all available engines in sequence (WASM → Hunspell → Style → ML) with warm-up hooks.
2. WHEN text is submitted for checking THEN the system SHALL process it through language detection first, then all appropriate engines in parallel.
3. WHEN multiple engines detect the same or similar issues THEN the system SHALL deduplicate using canonical signatures (span range + normalized message).
4. WHEN an engine fails or times out THEN the system SHALL continue processing with remaining engines using per-engine defaults (nlprule:200ms, hunspell:100ms, vale:300ms) and retry counts.
5. WHEN new engines become available THEN the system SHALL provide a plugin architecture to integrate them without major code changes.
6. WHEN engines operate in different modes THEN the system SHALL tag them as 'offline' vs 'online' and provide graceful offline behavior.

### Requirement 2: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a NoteSphere user, I want grammar checking to be fast and responsive, so that I can receive feedback in real-time without disrupting my writing flow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN checking grammar in documents up to 10,000 characters THEN the system SHALL return results within 300ms on average devices.
2. WHEN processing longer documents THEN the system SHALL provide incremental results as they become available.
3. WHEN the same text is checked multiple times THEN the system SHALL utilize caching to improve response time.
4. WHEN running in a browser environment THEN the system SHALL use Web Workers to prevent UI blocking.
5. WHEN memory usage exceeds predefined thresholds THEN the system SHALL implement graceful degradation strategies.
6. WHEN the system is idle THEN it SHALL preload and initialize engines to minimize startup time.
7. WHEN the editor content changes THEN the system SHALL use sentence-level diffing for cache invalidation to avoid full re-scans.

### Requirement 3: Accuracy and Quality

**User Story:** As a NoteSphere user, I want highly accurate grammar and style suggestions, so that I can trust the system's recommendations and improve my writing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN checking common grammatical errors THEN the system SHALL achieve at least 90% precision and 85% recall compared to benchmark datasets.
2. WHEN suggesting corrections THEN the system SHALL provide contextually appropriate alternatives.
3. WHEN detecting style issues THEN the system SHALL clearly distinguish between grammar errors and style suggestions.
4. WHEN processing domain-specific content THEN the system SHALL adapt its recommendations accordingly.
5. WHEN false positives are identified THEN the system SHALL provide a feedback mechanism to improve future suggestions.

### Requirement 4: Cross-Platform Compatibility

**User Story:** As a NoteSphere user, I want the grammar assistant to work consistently across all my devices and browsers, so that I have a seamless experience regardless of platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running on desktop browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) THEN the system SHALL function with full capabilities.
2. WHEN running on mobile browsers THEN the system SHALL adapt its processing to mobile constraints.
3. WHEN operating in offline mode THEN the system SHALL provide core grammar checking functionality.
4. WHEN switching between devices THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent suggestion quality.
5. WHEN running in resource-constrained environments THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade features rather than fail.

### Requirement 5: Privacy and Security

**User Story:** As a NoteSphere user, I want my text to be processed securely and privately, so that my sensitive information remains protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN checking grammar THEN the system SHALL process all text locally by default.
2. WHEN optional cloud-based features are used THEN the system SHALL clearly inform users and obtain consent.
3. WHEN text is processed THEN the system SHALL not store content longer than necessary for processing.
4. WHEN third-party services are integrated THEN the system SHALL anonymize data before transmission.
5. WHEN handling user data THEN the system SHALL comply with GDPR, CCPA, and other relevant privacy regulations.

### Requirement 6: Extensibility and Customization

**User Story:** As a NoteSphere user, I want to customize grammar checking rules and priorities, so that the system adapts to my personal writing style and preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN initializing THEN the system SHALL support user-defined rule configurations.
2. WHEN checking text THEN the system SHALL respect user preferences for rule priorities.
3. WHEN suggesting corrections THEN the system SHALL allow users to add custom dictionaries.
4. WHEN detecting style issues THEN the system SHALL allow toggling specific style rules on/off.
5. WHEN processing specialized content THEN the system SHALL support domain-specific rule sets.

### Requirement 7: Internationalization and Language Support

**User Story:** As an international NoteSphere user, I want grammar checking in multiple languages, so that I can write correctly regardless of the language I'm using.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN initializing THEN the system SHALL detect the user's language preference.
2. WHEN English text is detected THEN the system SHALL provide full-featured grammar checking.
3. WHEN text in other supported languages is detected THEN the system SHALL apply appropriate language-specific rules.
4. WHEN mixed-language content is detected THEN the system SHALL process each language segment appropriately.
5. WHEN a language is not fully supported THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate limited capabilities for that language.

### Requirement 8: Integration with NoteSphere

**User Story:** As a NoteSphere user, I want the grammar assistant to be seamlessly integrated with the editor, so that I can access all features without disrupting my workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN editing text in NoteSphere THEN the system SHALL provide real-time grammar checking.
2. WHEN hovering over highlighted issues THEN the system SHALL display explanations and suggestions.
3. WHEN selecting a suggestion THEN the system SHALL apply the correction with a single click.
4. WHEN the editor content changes THEN the system SHALL efficiently update only affected portions of the analysis.
5. WHEN the user dismisses a suggestion THEN the system SHALL remember this preference for similar cases.
