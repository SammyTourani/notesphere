# NoteSphere MegaEngine Grammar Assistant: Authoritative Blueprint

This document serves as the authoritative blueprint for the Multi-Engine Grammar System (MEGS), combining the requirements, design, and implementation plan with critical cross-cutting enhancements.

## Key Cross-Cutting Enhancements

1. **Engine Initialization Sequencing**: Engines must be initialized in the specific order: WASM → Hunspell → Style → ML, with warm-up hooks to ensure optimal startup performance.

2. **Per-Engine Defaults**: Each engine has specific timeout defaults (nlprule:200ms, hunspell:100ms, vale:300ms) and retry counts to ensure balanced performance and reliability.

3. **Cache Invalidation Strategy**: Sentence-level diffing must be used for cache invalidation to avoid full re-scans when editor content changes.

4. **Issue Deduplication**: Canonical signatures (span range + normalized message) must be used to deduplicate issues detected by multiple engines.

5. **Language Detection Pipeline**: Language detection must be implemented as the first adapter in the pipeline to ensure proper language-specific processing.

6. **Engine Mode Tags**: Engines must be tagged as 'offline' or 'online' to enable graceful offline behavior when connectivity is limited.

7. **Hot-Reload Support**: The API's configure() method must apply new rules/dictionaries at runtime without requiring system restart.

8. **Worker Pool Health Checks**: Worker pools must run dummy tasks at initialization to verify proper functioning.

9. **Two-Phase Integration Testing**: Final integration is split into initial smoke/load testing (20a) and full regression/performance/cross-platform testing (20b).

## Modular Architecture

The system maintains a modular architecture with:

- **Orchestration Layer**: Manages the workflow of text processing through multiple engines
- **Engine Adapters**: Standardized interfaces for all grammar engines
- **Results Consolidation**: Deduplication and merging of results from multiple engines
- **Caching System**: Performance optimization through intelligent caching
- **Worker Pool**: Parallel processing to prevent UI blocking
- **Integration API**: Clean interface for NoteSphere to interact with MEGS

## Implementation Sequence

The implementation follows a carefully designed sequence to ensure each component builds on a solid foundation:

1. Core architecture and interfaces
2. Base orchestrator framework
3. Engine adapter system
4. NLPRule WASM engine adapter
5. Hunspell engine adapter
6. Style checker engine adapter
7. Results consolidation system
8. Caching system
9. Web Worker pool management
10. Performance monitoring
11. Configuration management system
12. NoteSphere integration API
13. Language detection and support
14. Privacy and security features
15. Comprehensive error handling
16. Cross-platform compatibility
17. User feedback and learning system
18. Comprehensive testing suite
19. Advanced features and optimizations
20a. Initial integration and smoke testing
20b. Full system testing and validation

## Critical Success Factors

For successful implementation, the following factors are critical:

1. **Performance**: The system must return results within 300ms for documents up to 10,000 characters.
2. **Accuracy**: The system must achieve at least 90% precision and 85% recall compared to benchmark datasets.
3. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: The system must function consistently across all major browsers and devices.
4. **Privacy**: All text processing must be done locally by default, with clear user consent for any cloud features.
5. **Extensibility**: The system must support user-defined rules, custom dictionaries, and domain-specific configurations.
