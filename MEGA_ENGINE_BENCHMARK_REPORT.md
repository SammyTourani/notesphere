## ⚡ Performance Analysis

### Processing Speed
- **Short Text (19 chars):** 0ms average
- **Medium Text (171 chars):** 0ms average  
- **Long Text (617 chars):** 0ms average

**Assessment:** Performance is excellent, well below the 200ms target. However, this may indicate the engine is not fully processing the text or there are initialization issues.

### Cache Efficiency
- **Cache Efficiency:** Not measurable (0ms processing times)
- **First Run Time:** 0ms
- **Cached Run Time:** 0ms

**Assessment:** Cache efficiency cannot be properly measured due to near-instant processing times, which may indicate the engine is not fully engaged.

## ✅ False Positive Analysis

**False Positive Rate:** 25.0% (1/4 clean texts flagged)

**Issues Found:**
- Clean technical text incorrectly flagged: "The API endpoint returns a 404 error when the user_id parameter is null or undefined"

**Assessment:** False positive rate is significantly above the 5% target, indicating over-aggressive detection or rule conflicts.
